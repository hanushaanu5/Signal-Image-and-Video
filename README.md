# Signal-Image-and-Video
The "Vaia" storm of a few years ago, which led to the destruction of entire forests in northeast Italy. This has favoured the spread of an insect (Bostrico in Italian) that has affected fallen trees but then spread and is spreading to healthy trees causing destruction of those too. The main aim is to use the technologies like Computer Vision and Python to detect the Infected regions and segregate them using a colour mask. So that the affected region can be properly identified. The video of the region will be passed to the code and then we will be able to detect the masked region with the infected trees and regions.
